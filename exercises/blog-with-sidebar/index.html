                    SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated television 
                    series created by marine science educator and animator 
                    Stephen Hillenburg that first aired on Nickelodeon as a 
                    sneak peek after the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards on May 1, 
                    1999, and officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It 
                    chronicles the adventures of the title character and his 
                    aquatic friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. 
                    The series received worldwide critical acclaim, and had 
                    gained popularity by its second season. As of 2019, the 
                    series is the fifth-longest-running American animated 
                    series. Its popularity made it a multimedia franchise, 
                    the highest rated Nickelodeon series, and the most 
                    profitable intellectual property for Paramount Consumer 
                    Products. By 2019, it had generated over $13 billion in 
                    merchandising revenue.

                    Many of the series' ideas originated in The Intertidal 
                    Zone, an unpublished educational comic book Hillenburg 
                    created in 1989 to teach his students about undersea life.
                    Hillenburg joined Nickelodeon in 1992 as an artist on 
                    Rocko's Modern Life. After Rocko was cancelled in 1996, 
                    he began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television 
                    series that same year, and in 1997, a seven-minute pilot 
                    was pitched to Nickelodeon. The network's executives wanted 
                    SpongeBob to be a child in school, but Hillenburg preferred 
                    SpongeBob to be an adult character. He was prepared to 
                    abandon the series, but compromised by creating Mrs. Puff 
                    and her boating school so SpongeBob could attend school as 
                    an adult.

                    The series has run for a total of fourteen seasons, and has 
                    inspired three feature films: The SpongeBob SquarePants 
                    Movie (2004), Sponge Out of Water (2015), and Sponge on the 
                    Run (2020). Two spin-off series, Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's 
                    Under Years and The Patrick Star Show, premiered in 2021. 
                    As of February 2022, four additional films are planned: 
                    three character spinoff films for Paramount+ and Netflix, 
                    and a theatrical SpongeBob film. The fourteenth season of 
                    the main series was announced in March 2022,[9] and 
                    premiered in November 2023. In September 2023, the show was 
                    renewed for a fifteenth season.

                    SpongeBob SquarePants has won a variety of awards including 
                    six Annie Awards, eight Golden Reel Awards, four Emmy 
                    Awards, two BAFTA Children's Awards, and a record-breaking 
                    twenty-one Kids' Choice Awards. A Broadway musical based on 
                    the series opened in 2017 to critical acclaim. The 
                    series is also noted as a cultural touchstone of 
                    Millennials and Generation Z.

                    The series revolves around the title character and an 
                    ensemble cast of his aquatic friends. SpongeBob SquarePants
                    is an energetic and optimistic yellow sea sponge who lives 
                    in a submerged pineapple. SpongeBob has a childlike 
                    enthusiasm for life, which carries over to his job as a fry 
                    cook at a fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab. One 
                    of his life's greatest goals is to obtain a boat-driving 
                    license from Mrs. Puff's Boating School, but he never 
                    succeeds. His favorite pastimes include "jellyfishing", 
                    which involves catching jellyfish with a net in a manner 
                    similar to butterfly catching, and blowing soap bubbles 
                    into elaborate shapes. He has a pet sea snail with a pink 
                    shell and a blue body named Gary, who meows like a cat.

                    This article is about the relaunched game, also known as A 
                    Realm Reborn. For the defunct original release, see Final 
                    Fantasy XIV (2010 video game).

                    Final Fantasy XIV[c] is a massively multiplayer online 
                    role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by 
                    Square Enix. Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida and 
                    released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows in August 
                    2013, it replaced the failed 2010 version, with subsequent 
                    support for PlayStation 4, macOS, PlayStation 5, and Xbox 
                    Series X/S. Final Fantasy XIV is set in the fantasy region 
                    of Eorzea, five years after the devastating Seventh Umbral 
                    Calamity which ended the original version. In the Calamity, 
                    the elder primal Bahamut escaped from his prison, an ancient
                    space station called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse 
                    across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, the player character
                    of the original version escaped, reappearing at the start 
                    of A Realm Reborn. As Eorzea cements its recovery, the 
                    player must fend off a reignited invasion from the Garlean
                    Empire.

                    The original Final Fantasy XIV was a commercial and 
                    critical failure. Then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada 
                    announced that a new team, led by Yoshida, would assume 
                    control and address the game's flaws. The new team both 
                    continued to develop and improve the original version, and 
                    secretly worked on a completely new replacement. This new 
                    game, codenamed "Version 2.0", used a new engine, improved 
                    server infrastructure, and revamped gameplay, interface, 
                    and story. The original version shut down in November 2012, 
                    followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.

                    The relaunched game released to largely positive reception; 
                    critics praised its solid mechanics and progression, and 
                    commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery. After a poor 
                    2013 fiscal year, Square Enix attributed the 2014 return to 
                    profitability partly to the game's strong sales and 
                    subscriber base. By October 2021, it had gained over 24 
                    million registered players and become the most profitable 
                    Final Fantasy game to date.[1] Final Fantasy XIV has 
                    received regular updates since release, including five 
                    major expansion packs: Heavensward (2015), Stormblood 
                    (2017), Shadowbringers (2019), Endwalker (2021), and 
                    Dawntrail (2024).

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG, featuring a persistent 
                    world where players can interact with each other and the 
                    environment. Players create and customize their characters 
                    for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial 
                    features, and starting class. Unlike in the original 
                    release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or
                    Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land 
                    are initially unavailable.[2] Players must also select a 
                    game server for each character. While all supported 
                    languages are available on every server, data centers are 
                    located in specific regions (i.e., North America, Europe, 
                    Japan, and Oceania) to reduce latency between client and 
                    server, and players are advised to choose a server in their 
                    region.[3] Regardless of server or language, players can 
                    use a large library of automatically translated game terms 
                    and general phrases, allowing players who speak different 
                    languages to communicate.[4]

                <h3>Interface</h3>
                <p>
                    PC and home console versions use a unified user interface 
                    (UI) and control scheme allowing for any combination of 
                    keyboard, mouse, and game controller. On PC, the game 
                    defaults to drag and drop menus, whereas on the console 
                    versions, the default interface resembles the PlayStation 
                    3's XrossMediaBar.[5] This bar is used to access menus, 
                    maps, logs, and configuration options. The head-up display 
                    for both versions includes a message log, party status 
                    menu, mini-map, and action bar. The size and location of 
                    all UI elements may be customized.[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actions and battle commands differ between PC and console 
                    versions. The PC versions support both point and click and 
                    keyboard input for commands or macros. Macro commands are 
                    customizable sequences of actions that allow players to 
                    execute desired abilities at a specific time. The home 
                    console versions instead map the action bar and macros to 
                    the "Cross Hotbar"—sets of four icons arranged in a cross 
                    shape. These are the grouped and accessed through a 
                    combination of the shoulder buttons and the directional pad
                    or the face buttons. Using each shoulder button to cycle 
                    through the cross sets, players have quick access to 
                    commands. This interface is also available to PC players 
                    who use controllers.[5]

            <p>
                The viral Kanafeh-inspired Chocolate Bar from a dessert spot 
                called The Fix in Dubai has been going viral and since lots of 
                us are a plane ride away, we’re going to make it at home and 
                even better! Oozing with pistachio butter and crispy toasted 
                shredded phyllo bits, this chocolate is the definition of 
                indulgence. Every single bite is so creamy but also so crispy 
                at the same time and the taste is so reminiscent of everyone’s 
                favorite Arab dessert! The best part is I promise it’s so easy 
                to make

            <h3>THE SHREDDED PHYLLO</h3>
            <p>
                We’re going to break this recipe down into sections based on
                each component in this recipe! Now if you don’t know yet, 
                the name of this chocolate bar is called Can’t Get Knafeh of
                It with Knafeh being a play on the word enough. Knafeh is a 
                Palestinian dessert popular throughout all of the Arab world
                that is made with crispy buttery phyllo strands and stuffed 
                with a sweet cheese filling. It’s usually covered in a 
                simple syrup and then topped with lots of pistachios. This 
                chocolate bar takes everything from the traditional dessert 
                minus the sweet cheese
                <br>
                <p>
                    We’re going to start with the shredded phyllo dough 
                    which is also called kataifi in Arabic. You can find it 
                    at most Arab/Middle Eastern grocery stores and this is 
                    what the <b>packaging looks like.</b> Apollo Athens Food
                    is my favorite brand to use for kataifi.
                    <p>
                <br>
                        
                <p>
                    Now if you happen to not have any Arab markets next 
                    to you, here are some other options you can use. 
                    There is nothing that compares to the real thing but
                    there are some other ingredients that can add a 
                    crunch. You can use puffed rice or puffed quinoa!
                </p>
                <br>
                            
                <p>
                    To prepare the kataifi, start by cutting it up 
                    into 1/4 to 1/2 inch long pieces. Kataifi 
                    usually comes in a package where it is all 
                    lumped up in an oval so you have to cut it. 
                    Once it’s cut, it’s time to heat up some 
                    vegetable oil in a frying pan. I prefer frying 
                    it for this recipe so it’s all evenly toasted 
                    and it gives you the best crispy texture. Once 
                    the oil is hot, 350°F, add the shredded phyllo 
                    n and fry until beautifully golden. Make sure 
                    to stir it around as it cooks so it evenly 
                    fries. If you are only frying one pan it’ll be 
                    easier to set up a bowl with a strainer above 
                    nd just strain out the shredded phyllo from the oil.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Transfer the fried phyllo to a plate with a 
                    paper towel to drain excess oil. Set aside 
                    to let it cool down a bit.
                </p>
                <h3>THE PISTACHIO BUTTER</h3>
                <p>
                    Moving on to the second component – 
                    PISTACHIO BUTTER! I posted a teaser for 
                    this recipe on the internet and I was 
                    shocked to see so many people did not 
                    know what pistachio paste/butter is. 
                    Everyone thought it was guacamole or 
                    other sorts of inedible things. Arabs 
                    use pistachios and pistachio butter in a
                    lot of our desserts so it’s totally 
                    normal to see a green color. But 
                    anyway, my favorite brand of Pistachio 
                    Butter to use is Gusto, and 
                    <b>here is the link here to buy it.</b> 
                    It has the creamiest consistency and a 
                    beautiful vibrant green color.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If it is a little too solid when you
                    open the jar, you can pop it in the 
                    microwave for 30 seconds. Add the 
                    pistachio butter to a bowl along 
                    with the fried shredded phyllo. Mix 
                    together well and now the filling is ready to go!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>NOTE:</b> Another option 
                    instead of buying pistachio 
                    butter is to make it yourself 
                    from scratch.You just need to 
                    blend pistachios in a strong 
                    food processor/blender for a 
                    really long time until it 
                    resembles nut butter. You can 
                    then mix it with melted white 
                    chocolate or sweetened condensed
                    milk to make it more smooth or 
                    creamy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>THE MOLDS</h3>
                <p>
                    The hardest part is done, the filling! We have one 
                    more thing to discuss before we move into actually 
                    making the chocolate bars. 
                    I want to make sure to 
                    over any questions you 
                    might have.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    What makes the Dubai 
                    Chocolate Bars unique is that they are really thick 
                    since they are stuffed with pistachio filling. It can 
                    be hard to find molds that are thick enough but it took
                    me a bit of searching before I stumbled on the 
                    perfect one. Here is the link to the one I got but 
                    it is currently out of stock. There are so many
                    other mold options availableband although they might not
                    be as thick, they will still be just as delicious.
